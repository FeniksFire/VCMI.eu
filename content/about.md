We want to rewrite the entire H3 engine (VCMI is NOT another mod) giving it new possibilities. Years of intensive work resulted in creating application with impressive amount of features. Among current features are:

* Complete gameplay mechanics
* Almost all objects, abilities, spells and other content
* Basic battle AI and adventure AI
* Many GUI improvements: high resolutions, stack queue, creature window
* Advanced and easy mod support - add new towns, creatures, heroes, artifacts and spells without limits or conflicts
* Launcher for easy configuration - download mods from our server and install them immediatelly!
* Random map generator that supports objects added by mods
* Linux, macOS and Android ports

VCMI is an open-source project licensed under GNU GPL 2.0 or later.

if you want help it, please contact us using our board.
